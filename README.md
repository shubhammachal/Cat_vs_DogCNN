# Cat_vs_DogCNN
A deep learning model to classify dogs and cats
This repository contains a deep learning model using CNN to classify between Cats and Dogs. The dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle.
<br>Libraries Used are:
<br>TensorFlow
<br>Keras
<br>matplotlib
<br>numpy
<br>pandas
<br>scikit-learn
<br>openCV
<br>
keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory is used for data preparation. It simplifies the process of loading and preprocessing image data for training machine learning models. The function takes care of reading images from the specified directory, resizing them, and converting them to a format suitable for training.
<br> Model used three convolution layers, three max pooling layers, one flatten layer and 3 fully connected layers. 
<br> ##Results:
<br>### Train accuracy: 99%
<br>### Validation accuracy: 80%
